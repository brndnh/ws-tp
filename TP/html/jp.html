				<p class="animatable fadeIn">throughout most of my life beyond elementary school, i have been using vancouver's transit system, translink to get around the city whenever I wanted to get to places with my friends. </p>
		
				<!-- as i wanted to use different image sizes for mobile viewing and larger displays, i used seperate divs and hid one or the other depending on the screen size of the user. furthermore, the alignment of the images is different depending on the viewport which i thought looked better. -->

					<img src="../images/shinjuku_small.jpg" alt="A photo taken from one of Shinjuku station's platforms, with another platform being full of people." class="photo-resize mobile-display">
				</div>

				<!-- i broke apart my paragraph using two <br> tags as it allowed for spacing between the <p>'s without having the need to create another tag -->
				<p class="aligned-text animatable fadeIn">
					it was fascinating to me how I could just get across most of the city without having to drive a car. my friends in california and texas all drive everywhere to get anything done in comparison. 
					<br> <br>
					having been familiarized with how train stations and busses work back at home, I was overwhelmingly surprised by how efficient and just massive the metro systems were in Japan and to an extent, South Korea's subways.
					<br> <br>
					it all moves like clockwork; they connect all over the gigantic city, and people just flow in and out of train stations that are way bigger than the ones here in vancouver.
				</p>

				<!-- "no-display" refers to no element being displayed when opened on mobile, and "mobile-display" is the opposite, showing up exclusively on mobile. this ends up being used back and forth within this section for responsive images -->

					having grown up in a place where there was only one aquarium with really expensive tickets, the thought of viewing marine life just because never really crossed my mind.
					<br><br>
					this all changed when i was planning out my next day on the whim reading my travel booklet, and it suggested going to a local aquarium in tokyo. it was on this day that i acquired my profound interest towards sea mammals.
